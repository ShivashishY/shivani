- What is the user need?
- Why is it important to solve?
- What are the expected solutions?
- What are the unexpected solutions?
- What are the known pros/cons of each?
- What do we still not know?
- How do we make it known?
- What are the risks?
- How will we mitigate the risks?
- How will we assess progress & results?

Iterate on each question a few times until you reach the kernel.
All PMs can use this framework, but it's especially useful for PM leaders to vet features & give feedback.

This type of thinking comes naturally to some PM leaders, others need to build this muscle. Do it often enough & it becomes instinctual. It's really vital to get right because you can't possibly have all the context as a PM leader, yet are responsible for sound product decisions
This is also an example of leading by asking questions, rather than leading by providing solutions or by being a critic. Don't get me wrong, 

> 'you do need to wear the "solution hat" or the "critic hat" at times.'

But I firmly believe in keeping the "question hat" on by default.
