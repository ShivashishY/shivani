If you think B2B product management is challenging, remember that consumer product management is a whole another challenge altogether.

<!-- more -->

A sensible null hypothesis for consumer products is that the user doesn't care about your product, doesn't have time to use it, doesn't understand its purpose, will skip any onboarding tutorials, won't read UI copy, will forget about it after signing up or installing it.won't invite others to use it, will use the password reset flow to sign in Every Single Time, would rather use TikTok or Instagram or YouTube or Netflix instead of your product, doesn‚Äôt know about the existence of that superb feature that took your team 2 years to build.

will disallow push notifications, will ignore or unsubscribe from your marketing emails, will not upgrade to the paid version even if rationally it seems worth it, will let the subscription lapse, will readily switch to a shiny new competing product.

Oh, if it isn't clear, none of the aspects of the null hypothesis are the user's fault. Good consumer prod mgmt is about understanding that users have a lot going on and by default don't want to engage with your product. And it's the PM & team's job to deal with that reality.

## All that to say: consumer product management is hard.

A sensible null hypothesis for B2B products is that the customer doesn‚Äôt really need your product, will not pay for it, and will not deploy or use it. Starting from this place ùòßùò∞ùò≥ùò§ùò¶ùò¥ you to think about what needs to be true about your target customers, your chosen product features & differentiators, your pricing & messaging such that the null hypothesis can be rigorously rejected.
Too many B2B product teams start with the assumption that plenty of customers badly need their product, will pay for it, & will be glad to deploy & use it.
They think their job is to define the priority order of features, improve product usability, & build the product. 

> Wrong.

## 4 questions to avoid B2B product failure:

-    What acute customer problems does your product solve?
-    Why would they pick your product over the alternatives?
-   Why would they change ingrained habits for your product?
-   Will these answers be true for enough customers?

## Last but not least, remember this about B2B products:

-   For your customer, the chief alternative to your product is ùòØùò∞ùòµ  your most formidable competitor's product.
-   The default alternative is simply inaction.
-   And a close second is often a spreadsheet. 

## And we haven't even talked about the non-user side of it:

making sense of conflicting experiment results, mediating 100s of different opinions on what to build & how, tensions between scaling infra & building features, being at the mercy of platform gatekeepers, and on and on.

What else should be included in the null hypothesis for consumer / B2C products?
