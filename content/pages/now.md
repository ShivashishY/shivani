## Exploring

Recently I am doing a sabbatical break, and spend my time to read books, watch some TV-Shows, Deep diving into different marketing tactics, and Relearning some old Marketing, Finance & Sales Fundamental topics.

## Research Interest

Data Mining and Network Science For Market
Applications: using network models and data science to solve interdisciplinary problems in complex systems such as financial market (e.g., information diffusion & trading behavior), social network (e.g., online / mobile phone social interactions), and biology (e.g., species invasions via global shipping) in close collaboration with domain experts.
Theory: network representation of various types of data; in particular, methods and influences of embedding rich information such as higher-order dependencies into networks.

## Writing

I have been thinking about writing a book on an idea that I have been most excited about for the last two years. But also writing book which can help new-bies to learn complex things in a easy way. I'm currently working on the first draft.

But more about that, later.
